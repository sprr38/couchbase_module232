Note:- 

All those Metrics are shown in customized Grafana Dashboard using various Datasources, mainly used influxDb and Prometheus.

By default Prometheus does not support authentication so we will implement either "nginx reverse proxy"/"APICast Redhat 3scale Gateway" for basic authentication or Token Based authentication.

Customized Grafana Dashboard is running on Surface Hub as UWP Application with anonymous user (Can only view the metrics ).
